Least connections

The minimum connection method is based on the current connection status of the server for load balancing.
When a request comes, the server with the least current connection number will be selected to process the request.
This can also be extended to select the server based on the minimum CPU usage of the server and the efficiency of processing requests per unit of time.
The minimum number of connections method is only an algorithm for dynamically allocating servers.
Through parameter calculation of various dimensions, a more balanced solution for dynamically allocating servers can be found suitable for different scenarios.
