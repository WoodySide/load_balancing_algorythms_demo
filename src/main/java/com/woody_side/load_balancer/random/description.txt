Random

Through the system random function, one of them is randomly selected for access according to the size of the back-end server list.
It can be known from the theory of probability statistics that as the amount of calls increases, its actual effect is getting closer and closer
to the average distribution of traffic to each back-end server, which is the effect of polling.
