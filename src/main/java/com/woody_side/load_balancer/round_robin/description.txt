Round robin

This method continuously rotates a list of services that are attached to it.
When the virtual server receives a request, it assigns the connection to the first service in the list,
and then moves that service to the bottom of the list.

 Advantage:

- Simple implementation, no need to record the status of various services, it is a stateless load balancing strategy.

 Disadvantage:

- When the performance of each server is inconsistent, it cannot be allocated according to the performance of the server,
and server resources cannot be reasonably used.
